      "The purpose of this course is to provide a broad introduction to the fundamental concepts, tasks,\n",
      "and techniques of natural language processing, and its recent advances based on large language\n",
      "models and applications for interdisciplinary subjects. The successful student will finish the\n",
      "course with specific modeling and analytical skills, knowledge of the most important language\n",
      "concepts and machine learning schemes, and a broad understanding of natural\n",
      "language\n",
      "processing models and practice. The course will serve to prepare the student for further study of\n",
      "NLP and AI in general, as well as to inform any work involving the design of computer\n",
      "programs for substantial application domains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prerequisites\n",
      "This course is designed for junior/senior undergraduate students majoring in computer science,\n",
      "information science, linguistics, and other related areas. Students who take this course are\n",
      "expected to be able to write code in some programming languages (e.g., Python is\n",
      "recommended) proficiently, and finish courses in algorithms, probability, and statistics. Linear\n",
      "algebra is optional, but highly recommended. It would be beneficial if the students have prior\n",

      "Lectures\n",
      "Lectures are an important part of this course. While we will generally follow the course text,\n",
      "lecture is an opportunity to emphasize certain topics, to present additional examples, to clarify\n",
      "murkier parts of the text, and to cover complementary technical material.\n",

      "Lab/Discussion Section\n",
      "\n",
      "\fThe course includes a weekly lab/discussion section for digging more deeply into aspects of the\n",
      "course material. At some times, the GSI and the IA will work through examples of problems to\n",
      "help students cement\n",
      "the concepts and build strategies for attacking homework and exam\n",
      "problems. At other times, the GSI and the IA will highlight how the foundational course\n",
      "concepts are being extended and applied in contemporary problems and systems. Students will\n",
      "acquire hands-on experience through individual and/or pair programming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Office Hours\n",
      "The instructors will have regularly scheduled office hours each week. You are encouraged to\n",
      "make use of these to discuss aspects of the course including lecture material and the homework\n",
      "problems. In cases where you cannot make office hours, contact the course staff to arrange an\n",

      "Online Resources\n",
      "Canvas\n",

      "Piazza\n",
      "We will use Piazza as an online forum for the course. Piazza has various benefits to students\n",
      "who, despite legitimate efforts to understand course material, are confused by course concepts or\n",
      "assignment expectations, and can seek clarification online. If you are asking a question about the\n",
      "assignment that others might have already asked, please first check to see if the question has\n",
      "already been answered in Piazza. It also provides students with greater mastery an opportunity to\n",
      "deepen their understanding by explaining course material to their fellow students. This course\n",
      "wholeheartedly supports such uses of Piazza.\n",
      "\n",
      "Piazza does, however, have downsides. Some students are tempted to turn to Piazza prematurely,\n",
      "before making a legitimate effort to understand the material from the lecture, discussion, and\n",
      "textbook sources. While doing so might get an answer to a specific question sooner, it robs a\n",
      "student of the opportunity to form a deeper understanding of the material and to develop personal\n",
      "resourcefulness skills that are valuable throughout a career.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, please be thoughtful in your use of Piazza:\n",
      "\n",
      "● Check to see if a question you have has already been asked before asking it.\n",
      "● Do not make your (partial) solutions to a problem visible to other students, either in a\n",
      "question (“this is how I’ve solved it so far…”) or in a response (“here is how I did it…”).\n",
      "You can create private postings that only the instructors can see for questions of this type.\n",
      "\n",
      "\f● Always be respectful in how you address others on Piazza, just like you should be in all\n",
      "\n",

      "Assignments\n",
      "All assignments will be posted and submitted on Gradescope. There will be four homework\n",
      "assignments in this course, due at approximately two to three-week intervals. These may involve\n",
      "some programming or other software work, and also will involve mathematical analysis, critical\n",
      "thinking, and other demonstrations of mastery of the material. Do not leave problem sets\n",
      "(especially any programming tasks) to the last minute, as network servers sometimes go down,\n",
      "and working through the problems usually takes longer than you think (even when you take this\n",

      "Late Policy\n",
      "To be considered on time, assignments must be turned in by 11:59pm on the due date. We will\n",
